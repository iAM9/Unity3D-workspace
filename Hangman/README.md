# Hangman

The game is a clone of the classic 'guess the letter' game, Hangman.
The game allows you to add/remove/update your own words. To do so, in Wndows, go to C:/Users/[name]/AppData\LocalLow\Kitaab World\Hangman\Words Database and edit the "words.txt" file. The game will recognize the new words and will give players the chance to guess the new words.
